        <h1>How an Ex-Cop Rigged McDonald’s Monopoly Game and Stole Millions</h1>
        <p {% if not paywall.show %} class="paytext" {% endif %}>
            <span>O</span>n Aug. 3, 2001, a McDonald’s film crew arrived in the bustling beach town of Westerly,
                Rhode Island. They carried their cameras and a giant cashier’s check to a row of townhouses, and knocked
                on the door of Michael Hoover. The 56-year-old bachelor had called a McDonald’s hotline to say he’d won
                <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/fidel-castro-hates-monopoly-and-12-more-reasons-to-love-it">their
                    Monopoly competition</a>. Since 1987, McDonald’s customers had feverishly collected Monopoly game
                pieces attached to drink cups, french fry packets, and advertising inserts in magazines. By completing
                groups of properties like Baltic and Mediterranean Avenues, players won cash or a Sega Game Gear, while
                “Instant Win” game pieces scored a free Filet-O-Fish or a Jamaican vacation. But Hoover, a casino pit
                boss who had recently filed for bankruptcy, claimed he’d won the grand prize–$1 million.

            the Powerball</a>, the odds of Hoover’s win were 1 in 250 million. There were two ways to win the Monopoly
            grand prize: Find the “Instant Win” game piece like Hoover, or match Park Place with the elusive Boardwalk
            to choose between a heavily taxed lump sum or a $50,000 check every year for 20 years. Just like the
            Monopoly board game, which was invented as a warning about the destructive nature of greed, players traded
            game pieces to win, or outbid each other on eBay. Armed robbers even held up restaurants demanding Monopoly
            tickets. “Don’t go to jail! Go to McDonald’s and play Monopoly for real!” cried Rich Uncle Pennybags, the
            game’s mustachioed mascot, on TV commercials that sent customers flocking to buy more food. Monopoly quickly
            became the company’s most lucrative marketing device since the Happy Meal.</p>
            <p>Inside Hoover’s home, Amy Murray, a loyal McDonald’s spokesperson, encouraged him to tell the camera
                about the luckiest moment of his life. Nervously clutching his massive check, Hoover said he’d fallen
                asleep on the beach. When he bent over to wash off the sand, his <em>People</em> magazine fell into the
                sea. He bought another copy from a grocery store, he said, and inside was an advertising insert with the
                “Instant Win” game piece. The camera crew listened patiently to his rambling story, silently recognizing
                the inconsequential details found in stories told by liars. They suspected that Hoover was not a lucky
                winner, but part of a major criminal conspiracy to defraud the fast-food chain of millions of dollars.
                The two men behind the camera were not from McDonald’s. They were undercover agents from the FBI. </p>
            <p>This was <a

                McSting. </a></p>
            <p>At the FBI’s Jacksonville Field Office in Florida, Special Agent Richard Dent added the Hoover videotape
                to his growing pile of evidence. Sandy-haired and highly organized, Dent was a 13-year veteran of the
                Bureau, who spent his days investigating public corruption and bank fraud. But in the last 12 months his
                desk had filled with fast-food paraphernalia. Leaflets for “Pick Your Prize Monopoly” and “Who Wants to
                Be a Millionaire?” described McDonald’s games played in 14 countries. He read small print that revealed
                how the odds were stacked against the customer: McDonald’s makes one piece from each set of properties
                extremely rare, so while thousands have three of the four railroads, the odds of pulling the Short Line
                Railroad—and winning a PT Cruiser—were 1 in 150 million. </p>
            <p>Dent’s investigation had started in 2000, when a mysterious informant called the FBI and claimed that
                McDonald’s games had been rigged by an insider known as “Uncle Jerry.” The person revealed that
                “winners” paid Uncle Jerry for stolen game pieces in various ways. The $1 million winners, for example,
                passed the first $50,000 installment to Uncle Jerry in cash. Sometimes Uncle Jerry would demand cash up
                front, requiring winners to mortgage their homes to come up with the money. According to the informant,
                members of one close-knit family in Jacksonville had claimed three $1 million prizes and a Dodge
                Viper.</p>
            <p>When Dent alerted McDonald’s headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, executives were deeply concerned. The
                company’s top lawyers pledged to help the FBI, and faxed Dent a list of past winners. They explained
                that their game pieces were produced by a Los Angeles company, Simon Marketing, and printed by Dittler
                Brothers in Oakwood, Georgia, a firm trusted with printing U.S. mail stamps and lotto scratch-offs. The
                person in charge of the game pieces was Simon’s director of security, Jerry Jacobson. </p>

            <p>Dent thought he had found his man. But after installing a wiretap on Jacobson’s phone, he realized that
                his tip had led to a super-sized conspiracy. Jacobson was the head of a sprawling network of mobsters,
                psychics, strip-club owners, convicts, drug traffickers, and even a family of Mormons, who had falsely
                claimed more than $24 million in cash and prizes. But who among them had betrayed Jacobson, and why?
                Dent knew agents had to move carefully. If they apprehended a “winner” too soon, he or she might alert
                other members of the conspiracy who would destroy evidence, or flee. With the scheme still in full
                swing, the FBI needed to team up with McDonald’s to catch Uncle Jerry and his crew red-handed.</p>
            <p>JEROME PAUL JACOBSON always dreamed of becoming a police officer. He was born in 1943, in Youngstown,
                Ohio, and moved to Miami as a teenager. Chronic allergies and a series of unlucky injuries always seemed
                to ruin his ambitions, like when he applied for the Marines, but was discharged from basic training with
                high arches. In 1976 he was sworn in to Florida’s Hollywood Police Department, but just a year later he
                injured his wrist in an altercation. During a prolonged medical leave, in 1980, Jacobson collapsed with
                a severe paralysis in his arms, legs, eyes and respiratory system. Doctors diagnosed a rare neurological
                disorder, and Jacobson’s police officer wife, Marsha, took a leave of absence to care for him. “I became
                his private nurse, I bathed him… massaged his muscles, fed him,” she recalled. With Jacobson unfit to
                return to work, the city terminated him. By 1981 the couple had moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where
                Jacobson recovered enough to work as a mechanic, building alternators for cars he couldn’t afford.</p>
            <p>Luckily, Marsha was offered a job as a security auditor for the accounting firm Arthur Young, and was
                assigned to one of their clients, Dittler Brothers. In 1981, she recommended her husband for a job there
                too, but the couple constantly argued at work, and by 1983 they had divorced. Finding his feet in
                private security, Jacobson started to climb the ranks until he oversaw all production for Dittler’s
                client, Simon Marketing, and their $500 million McDonald’s account. </p>
            <p>When Jacobson marched through the printing works, with his slicked-back hair and a little paunch that
                overhung his belt, he looked every part the ex-cop. He was quick with a joke, but commanded respect for
                his hard work and obsession with loss-prevention. “He inspected workers’ shoes to check they weren’t
                stealing McDonald’s game pieces,” one colleague told me, while a truck driver who transported game
                pieces recalled: “I couldn’t even go to the bathroom without someone going with me.” Impressed by
                Jacobson’s attention to detail and police credentials, in 1988 Simon Marketing poached him. </p>
            <p>“It was my responsibility to keep the integrity of the game and get those winners to the public,”
                Jacobson would later tell investigators. </p>
            <p>Before each bi-annual game, Jacobson arrived at the drab Dittler Brothers’ office at 5 a.m to observe
                their Omega III supercomputer making the McDonald’s prize draw. He watched the printing presses that
                roared for 24 hours a day for three months, using 100 railroad cars of paper to print half a billion
                game pieces. Laid end-to-end, the paper tickets would stretch from New York to Sydney—nearly two tickets
                for every American. Jacobson observed technicians applying the “INSTANT WINNER!” stamp to blank game
                pieces, and pioneered random watermarks that deterred counterfeiters. He locked the winning pieces in a
                vault behind coded keypads and dual-entry combination locks. It was Jacobson who personally scissored
                out the high-value game pieces and slipped them into envelopes, before sealing each corner with a
                tamper-proof metallic sticker. In a secret vest, of his invention, Jacobson transported the winning
                pieces to McDonald’s packaging factories across the country. </p>
            <p>Everything he did was overseen by an independent auditor. On flights she sat in coach, while Jacobson
                flew first class, where he tried to impress other passengers by flashing his old police badge. On one
                flight, Jacobson and another security manager sent an air steward back to show the accountant the empty
                liquor bottles they’d guzzled. When they arrived at the factory, Jacobson would summon a forklift of
                french fry containers, hide the winning game piece, and send it into the wild. Then he liked to hit a
                Ruth’s Chris steakhouse and order “everything”—more than he could eat, and charge it to his expense
                account. </p>
            <p>The 1980s was America’s “decade of greed,” and it was Jacobson’s job to create instant millionaires.
                Playing God was intoxicating, as was holding a stranger’s fate in the palm of his hands. Female
                employees among the 30 staff he controlled complained that he criticized how they dressed, and he often
                wrote up workers for mistakes. Jacobson’s $70,000 salary was six times his police officer’s pay, and he
                was obsessed with achieving the gold-medallion airline status, sometimes flying to factories via several
                cities to accrue airline points, to the irritation of those who had to shadow him.</p>

            <p>Jacobson was also deep into his own get-rich-quick scheme. He boasted to colleagues that he was waiting
                to collect his “riches” from a mysterious &nbsp;“investment.” All he needed was to find 10 more people
                to sign up and invest. “A psychic had told him to invest money and he would be richly rewarded,” one
                former colleague told me. But they believed he’d invested in a Ponzi scheme. One colleague told me
                Jacobson swore by the advice of a local fortune teller, and often excused himself from work, saying: “I
                think she needs to tell me something.” </p>
            <div>
                <div><p><span>“</span>In a secret vest, of his invention, Jacobson transported the winning pieces to

            <p>This was the man entrusted with creating a theft-proof system for one of America’s largest corporations.
                It was a thrill to protect the Monopoly promotion, and only a natural part of his job to consider the
                system’s flaws. But soon the temptation to steal had become irresistible. </p>
            <p>One day in 1989, at a family gathering in Miami, Jacobson slipped his step-brother, Marvin Braun, a game
                piece worth $25,000. “I don’t know if I just wanted to show him I could do something, or bragging,”
                Jacobson later admitted, but he just needed “to see if I could do it.” When his local butcher in Atlanta
                heard that Jacobson was in charge of the McDonald’s Monopoly prizes, he said he’d like to win a prize.
                Jacobson boasted that he could make it happen, but it would look too suspicious because they were
                friends and neighbors. The butcher offered to find a distant friend to claim a $10,000 prize, and gave
                Jacobson $2,000 for the stolen ticket. It was easy money.</p>
            <p>McDonald’s was already overwhelmed with employee theft. In Sheboygan, Wisconsin, a 17-year-old restaurant
                employee was arrested for stealing 3,000 Monopoly game pieces. In response, McDonald’s started handing
                out game pieces from a secure roll at the counter. As a result, Jacobson was removed from the “seeding”
                process for several years. But in 1995, as McDonald’s ramped up the scale of the promotion, game pieces
                were ‘blown’ onto soft-drink cups and hash-brown wrappers. That year, Ronald McDonald and Monopoly’s
                Rich Uncle Pennybags rang the opening bell on Wall Street, and Jacobson found himself back in charge of
                distributing the game pieces.</p>
            <p>During that 1995 prize draw, something happened that would change the game. According to Jacobson, when
                the computerized prize draw selected a factory location in Canada, Simon Marketing executives re-ran the
                program until it chose an area in the USA. Jacobson claimed he was ordered to ensure that no high-level
                prizes ever reached the Great White North. “I knew what we were doing in Canada was wrong,” Jacobson
                recalled. “Sooner or later, somebody was going to be asking questions about why there were no winners in
                Canada.” Believing the game was rigged, he decided to cash in, too. </p>
            <p>Not long afterward, Jacobson opened a package sent to him by mistake from a supplier in Hong Kong. Inside
                he found a set of the anti-tamper seals for the game-piece envelopes—the only thing he needed to steal
                game pieces en route to the factory. “I would go into the men’s room of the airport,” he later admitted,
                the only place the female auditor couldn’t follow him. “I would go into a stall. I would take the seal
                off.” Then he’d pour the winning game pieces into his hand, replace them with “commons,” and re-seal the
                envelope. First, he stole a $1 million “Instant Win” game piece and locked it in a safety deposit box.
                Then he stole documents that he claimed proved the Canada conspiracy. “I thought I would need that to
                protect myself,” Jacobson recalled. If his employer ever fired him, he had a “get out of jail free”
                card. But when he stole another $1 million game piece, Jacobson did something awesome.</p>

                <p>— Jerome Jacobson</p></div>
            <p>On Nov. 12, 1995, a donations clerk at the St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Tennessee ripped open
                the morning’s mail, and discovered a brightly colored card. At first, Tammie Murphy assumed it was junk
                mail, until she noticed the tiny Monopoly game piece inside. McDonald’s officials descended on the
                hospital and examined the game piece under a jeweler’s eyepiece. Ronald McDonald himself attended a
                press conference, where the hospital was announced the $1 million winner. Despite <a
                        href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/08/us/donor-turns-fast-food-into-big-bucks-for-hospital.html">an
                    investigation</a>, <em>The New York Times</em> could not uncover the identity of the generous donor.
            </p>
            <p>Back in Atlanta, Jacobson’s butcher was ready for another win. This time, he proposed that he’d travel
                with his sister to Maryland, where she would “find” the lucky game piece on a box of fries. Jacobson
                gave the butcher a stolen game piece worth $200,000 in exchange for $45,000 of the winnings. “I figured
                I could trust him because he paid me the first time,” Jacobson recalled. But the butcher double-crossed
                him in Maryland and claimed the prize himself. All Jacobson got was $4,000, and a big surprise. One
                evening, Jacobson was watching television when he saw a commercial for the McDonald’s Monopoly game. To
                his complete disbelief, he watched his butcher celebrating his big win. He reached for the phone.</p>
            <p>“You live here,” Jacobson protested. “You know me.”</p>
            <p>LOTTERIES AND SWEEPSTAKES have been mired in corruption since biblical times, when lots were drawn to
                read the will of God. But it was the medieval Italians who first used prize drawings as a sales
                promotion. In 1522, a Venetian man was condemned to death after tampering with the prize draw for 1,500
                golden ducats, a parcel of silk, and a live wild cat. Allegations of fraud and abuse shuttered an
                English lottery in 1621 that funded America’s earliest colonies. In the New World, centuries of
                sweepstakes chicanery followed, until 1890, when lotteries were banned in every state except Delaware
                and Louisiana. This ushered in an era of promotional “contests” in which marketers could avoid
                prosecution by making no purchase necessary. Today, you can enter a McDonald’s contest without buying a
                burger—just write in for a free ticket and take your chances.</p>
            <p>It was by chance that Jacobson met the man who would industrialize his Monopoly scam. Jacobson was
                sitting in Atlanta’s airport one day in 1995, when a giant gentleman folded himself into the next seat.
                Gennaro Colombo, 32, looked like Al Capone, and when Jacobson inquired where he was headed, Colombo
                unzipped a bulging purse full of $100 bills, and said: “Atlantic City.” Colombo said he was born in
                Sicily and raised in Brooklyn before moving to South Carolina, where he operated adult nightclubs,
                underground casinos, and a sports-betting ring. He claimed he was a member of New York’s infamous
                Colombo crime family.</p>
            <p>When Jacobson revealed that he worked in promotional gaming, Colombo was intrigued. He enjoyed finding
                new ways to cheat a system. When Charleston County, Georgia, passed new laws restricting where strip
                clubs could be operated, Colombo opened a house of worship named The Church of Fuzzy Bunnies. “I want
                them to read the Bible for two hours every night, and then we’ll drink and let the girls dance,” said
                Colombo, who claimed that God came to him in a dream with the idea. By November 1995, Jacobson had
                slipped Colombo a game piece for a brand new Dodge Viper. The Italian, who was obsessed with <em>The
                    Godfather</em> and had ambitions of becoming an actor, agreed to wave a giant car key in a
                McDonald’s commercial. Instead of the sports car, he took the money, his wife, Robin Colombo, told me.
                “He was a big guy. A Viper? No.” </p>
            <p>With a mop of black curly hair and a contagious laugh, Robin, 34, had become engaged to Colombo after a
                two-week romance. She was thrilled with the trappings of a Mafia wife: bodyguards, chauffeurs, two
                rottweilers and a last name that commanded fear and respect. By now, Colombo was traveling with friends
                from Atlanta to Boston, where they’d “win” $1 million prizes, thanks to stolen tickets from Jacobson.
                Soon Colombo introduced Robin to Jacobson, calling him “Uncle Jerry,” and in 1996, her father, William
                Fisher, received a stolen $1 million winning ticket. Fisher traveled from his home in Jacksonville,
                Florida, to Litchfield, New Hampshire, to claim his prize, before Robin’s brother-in-law in Virginia
                became a millionaire, too. Every winner sent a kickback in cash via the Colombos to Jacobson.</p>
            <p>In 1997, Robin introduced Colombo to her friend Gloria Brown, 37, at an Applebee’s in Jacksonville. “He
                asked... how much money I could come up with... in order to be eligible,” Brown recalled. A few weeks
                later, on the side of Interstate 95, Brown handed Colombo $40,000 in cash. He showed her a tiny bottle
                containing the $1 million game piece, dwarfed by his giant hand. “I’ll let you know the rest later,” he
                mumbled. </p>
            <p>Brown traveled to South Carolina to “find” her prize, because too many recent winners now lived in
                Jacksonville. “It was so secretive,” she recalled. Colombo and a cousin drove Brown to a McDonald’s and
                parked a safe distance away. They coached Brown what to tell McDonald’s staff, but doubts suddenly
                consumed her. “I had to just tell, you know, outright lies,” she realized. She thought about running. Do
                I lose it all or do I keep going? But she did the deed, and afterward found the two Italians sweating.
                “They were a little nervous because it took so long,” Brown recalled. They helped her fill out the prize
                form, writing her name along with the cousin’s South Carolina address. To make it appear like she lived
                with the cousin, Brown recorded the message on his answering machine, and later told reporters a
                long-winded story about finding the winning ticket while cleaning out her car.</p>
            <p>Robin told me that Uncle Jerry’s money soon funded certain Colombo-run businesses, including a private
                members’ club in Hilton Head. She thought he was sophisticated and liked the way he dressed. In return,
                Jacobson sent other “opportunities” to the Colombos, Robin told me. Late one night, she was stoned and
                rifling through the kitchen for a snack, when she found in their freezer a mysterious plastic bag.
                Inside was a single gray-colored M&amp;M candy, which was part of a promotional contest, she said. In
                1997, the Mars candy company launched a competition to find an “impostor” M&amp;M, along with a game
                piece that made the winner an instant millionaire. (Mars did not respond to inquiries, but records show
                that Cyrk, a company that produced promotional materials for Mars, merged with Simon Marketing in 1997.)
                Colombo suddenly appeared behind her, grabbed the bag, and yelled:</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, Jacobson was now living with a huge secret—he had not even told his new wife, Linda, what he
                was doing. By now he had given his step-brother, Marvin Braun, three more game pieces, including one for
                $1 million. Braun, who owned a chain of maternity clothing stores, claimed he didn’t need the money. “I
                dropped tickets into Salvation Army tins,” he told me, “Jerry would give me a million-dollar ticket... I
                would give it away… I’ve flushed million-dollar tickets down toilets.” By 1998, Jacobson’s nephew, Mark
                Schwartz, had taken a $200,000 game piece after a meeting in Miami. “I told him what I wanted and the
                rest was his,” Jacobson recalled. “I wanted $45,000.” At Schwartz’s wedding that year, Jacobson was
                discussing the Monopoly game when a distant cousin fell into the conversation and also agreed to win a
                prize. Uncle Jerry’s family tree was sprouting money. </p>

            </div>
            <p>By the end of 1998, Jacobson had become Rich Uncle Pennybags, and America was his game board. He tooled
                around the United States stealing almost all the big-ticket game pieces, acquiring new properties on a
                whim, and collecting kickbacks from other players. Now he was hanging out with powerful Italians, he
                dressed in sharp suits and sometimes used the name “Geraldo Constantino.” He and his wife moved into a
                fine red-brick home in Lawrenceville, Georgia, where he tended to its perfect lawn. He purchased a plot
                of land on Lake Hartwell, a recreation lake on the Georgia border, and paid for expensive cruises, and
                joined a classic-car club. There, he sold one member four game pieces and used the $65,000 to buy a
                handsome Oldsmobile. Bill LaFoy, who lived opposite Jacobson, lost count of the new cars appearing on
                the driveway: “I used to kid him about where the winning tickets were,” he said. </p>
            <p>After three years married to Colombo, Robin had tired of life as a mobster’s wife. Since the birth of
                their son, Frankie, her husband seemed to spend all his time at his gentleman’s clubs and casinos.
                Meanwhile, Robin felt that the Colombos had cut her off from her friends. “They were the type of people
                who don’t like outsiders,” she said. Lonely and bored, she began confiding in Jacobson during late-night
                phone calls. One night, she told him that Colombo was sleeping with her personal trainer. “I was upset
                about my husband,” she said, “and he goes, ‘Well, you could marry me.’” </p>
            <p>“No, I can’t. I’m married,” she said quickly. “I love my husband.” </p>
            <p>Robin tried to make her marriage to Colombo work. “He had done some things in Charleston that I freaked
                out about,” she said, “I told him I needed to get out of South Carolina.” On May 7, 1998, they drove to
                the Georgia state line to look for land on which to build their dream home. Colombo’s pager had been
                beeping all morning, but he ignored it. Robin was behind the wheel of their Ford Explorer as they
                approached the entrance to the expressway. At the on-ramp, a tractor trailer blocked Robin’s view. When
                she swung onto the freeway, a speeding F-150 truck smashed into them, dragging their car 250 feet and
                into a concrete wall. Colombo crawled from the wreckage, but emergency crews had to use the Jaws of Life
                to cut Robin and her son free. </p>
            <p>“The policeman told me he thought I was gonna be the one to die because I was the one covered in blood,”
                Robin told me. But at the hospital, Colombo’s blood pressure dropped so low they wrapped his body in
                refrigerated blankets. “My mother-in-law ran over to me and told me she knew this was going to happen,”
                Robin recalled. “She had a vision in a dream the night before. That’s why she was trying to page him all
                day.” At his bedside, Robin shook Colombo’s giant arm, and begged him to wake up. “He was my soulmate,”
                Robin said. But two weeks later, the doctors turned off his life support. </p>
            <p>The secret of Jacobson’s success was that he recruited his co-conspirators at random, and soon he was
                looking for a replacement for Colombo. Jacobson was in London with his step-brother Marvin and their
                wives, waiting to board a Royal Caribbean cruise ship, when he met Don Hart and his wife. “The six of us
                were talking, and we found out that Mr. Hart and his wife were from the Atlanta area,” Jacobson
                recalled. “And they wound up changing tables to eat with us on the cruise.” Hart had sold his trucking
                company for a small fortune, and still had a network of contacts all over the United States. When
                Jacobson revealed his scam, Hart, an honest businessman, found it too good to be true. But he agreed to
                try it, to “see if it worked,” recalled Jacobson. In 1998, one of Hart’s accomplices redeemed a $200,000
                game piece. “After that Mr. Hart told me he didn’t want to be involved in handling any game piece
                tickets or handling any money,” Jacobson said. Instead, he introduced Jacobson to two friends who could
                find the needy and the greedy. </p>
            <p>The first was Richard Couturier, who owned a chain of fried-chicken joints. He was fooled into believing
                he was helping McDonald’s find real winners, because most people threw away their game pieces. “Mr.
                Jacobson said every time they ran the game and had winners, the sales were up 38 percent,” Couturier
                said. He mostly recruited random people he met at parties. At Mardi Gras in 1999, Couturier was riding
                on a float through the streets of New Orleans, tossing beads into the crowd, when he shouted to another
                reveler: “Would you be interested in being a McDonald’s winner!” Jacobson gave Couturier “around 10”
                winning pieces, including several for sports cars and two $1 million prizes. “If I bought a piece of
                property, I would borrow from my home equity and then Mr. Couturier would write a check to my
                home-equity loan,” Jacobson explained. </p>
            <p>Then, at a dinner party in Atlanta, Hart introduced Jacobson to Andrew Glomb, a gregarious gambler who
                lived in a luxury Spanish-style home in Fort Lauderdale. Glomb spent his days partying, or walking his
                dog through the lime trees that bordered his property, where neighbors all knew of his checkered past.
                In 1983, Glomb had been convicted of shipping pure cocaine on a Pan American flight from Miami to
                Dallas. He’d jumped bond and escaped to Europe for 16 months, before completing his 12-year sentence.
                Glomb mostly gave his winning tickets to old pals from his drug-trafficking days. “It was just the
                excitement, to have the power,” he told me. “Because I like you, I can make you a millionaire.” But
                Glomb’s winners introduced less salubrious characters to the scheme. In 1999, a million-dollar winner
                was a man who had pleaded guilty to distributing 400 pounds of cocaine in Pittsburgh, while running a
                numbers racket from an Italian restaurant.</p>
            <p>Glomb said his winners were all destitute: “They were on their ass... they had nothing. I mean, if you
                could imagine flying across country, giving somebody a million dollars, and I had to pick up the dinner
                check.” One day, Glomb arrived in Pennsylvania to visit his family, where his cousin picked him up at
                the airport. The cousin said: “I got to stop at McDonald’s because my kids wanna play this Monopoly
                game.” </p><p>Glomb smiled, and said: “You know, don’t waste your time.”</p>
            <p>Across America, McDonald’s customers were becoming frustrated by the Monopoly game. “Are McDonald’s
                employees keeping game cards to themselves?” asked a concerned citizen in a letter to <em>The</em> <em>Atlanta
                    Constitution</em>. “We’re talking money here,” said another player in North Miami who paid for a
                classified advert for the game pieces he couldn’t find. Instead of sticking those game pieces to
                customer’s soft drink cups and french fry packets, Jacobson sent them all to Andrew Glomb, including
                eight $1 million winners. “He told me, ‘Don’t talk about this, don’t talk about that,’” Glomb recalled.
                Paranoid Jacobson now had dozens of prize winners out there, appearing in TV commercials, and arguing
                with their spouses about the loot. His black hair had turned gray, and he was bothering his psychics
                about his future. One received a $50,000 game piece in exchange for chiropractic services and fortune
                telling (“he did both,” Jacobson said). But the psychic didn’t see how Jacobson’s fate had already been
                sealed.</p>
            <p>Ever since her husband died, Robin Colombo felt uneasy around her in-laws. The Colombos investigated the
                car crash, she said, suspecting that she might have killed her husband. “My mother-in-law, Ma, she told
                me, ‘Do you think if we didn’t know it was an accident you’d be sitting here today?’” At her husband’s
                funeral, Robin said her father-in-law promised to keep the New York side of the family at bay. “In my
                mind I was thinking, ‘Papa, I’m really not worried about them, I’m worried about you sniping me down,
                because I was the driver.’” (Speaking in a thick Sicilian accent, Colombo’s mother denied the family
                were in the Mafia but confirmed they are related to the late Joseph Colombo, former boss of the Colombo
                crime family.)</p>
            <p>Robin had tried to keep up the “good life” but had turned to forgery, and insurance and credit-card
                fraud. During one of her brief spells in prison, Robin felt the Colombos were “brainwashing” her own
                son, and said she didn’t want Frankie to grow up in the mob. She tried to cut herself off from “the
                family,” which she said infuriated them. “Frankie [was] their first grandson, and, you know how
                Sicilians are,” she said. Robin believes it was the Colombos who told the FBI that her father, William
                Fisher, her cousin, and best friend Gloria Brown had all illegally won McDonald’s prizes. They wanted
                her in jail, she said, to avenge the death of their son.</p>
            <p>“That was their retaliation,” she added. </p>
            <p>The tip to the FBI came in March 2000. Special Agent Dent called Amy Murray, the McDonald’s spokesperson,
                to say he believed that William Fisher, the $1 million winner of the 1996 “Deluxe Monopoly Game,” was a
                fraud. Murray was a quick-thinking Midwesterner who had risen through the ranks at McDonald’s, and was
                often the public face of the company during any drama. She was the “McQueen” of McDonald’s, said Joe
                Maggard, a disgraced Ronald McDonald actor who was convicted of making harassing phone calls while
                posing as the clown.</p>
            <p>Murray telephoned Fisher at his home in Jacksonville. “[Fisher] told Ms. Murray that he won the prize in
                Litchfield, New Hampshire, where he was living for a year,” Dent wrote in an affidavit. However,
                property and electricity records showed that Fisher had lived in Jacksonville all along. “I believe
                [Fisher] provided false and misleading information to Amy Murray,” wrote Dent. When he asked about
                Gloria Brown, Murray revealed that she, like Fisher, had re-routed her annual $50,000 checks to
                Jacksonville. </p>
            <p>Dent opened an official investigation, naming it Operation “Final Answer,” after the “Who Wants to Be a
                Millionaire?” McDonald’s game. The operation would involve 25 agents across the country who tracked
                20,000 phone numbers, and recorded 235 cassette tapes of telephone calls. “You work from the outside
                in,” explained John Hanson, a former FBI Special Agent who specializes in complex fraud schemes. “But
                you really want the people who devised the idea.” Hanson said the FBI would have investigated the
                McDonald’s scam just like any boiler-room stock fraud or pyramid scheme: by gathering evidence without
                anyone finding out. Jacobson made this hard by recruiting co-conspirators in person, in remote
                locations.</p>
            <p>On April 29, 2000, Jacobson was driving through the South Carolina countryside, with the peaks of the
                Appalachians in his windshield. In the passenger seat was his friend Dwight Baker, a real-estate
                developer who had sold Jacobson his lakeside plot. Baker was a well-respected member of the local Mormon
                church, and a devoted father-of-five who lived in a split-level house next to hay fields and farmland.
                He was a charismatic man with big dreams, who’d tried to build a championship golf course and a
                five-star resort, but couldn’t attract enough investors. The two men were equally ambitious, and they
                each had a wife named Linda.</p>
            <p>That spring, Baker was recovering from a terrible accident. The brakes had failed on his tractor and
                after rolling helplessly backward down a hill, Baker had damaged his spinal column in a crash. On
                hearing of Baker’s misfortune, Jacobson arrived and offered to get him out of the house. Baker feared he
                would never walk again, but Jacobson was insistent. He helped his friend into the car, and they drove up
                into the mountains. </p>
            <p>When Baker first found out that Jacobson controlled the McDonald’s Monopoly promotion, he had mixed
                feelings. “Well, in 1985 we lost our home,” he explained. “Our family had five children, and... for the
                last several years we’d been, as a family, chasing these game pieces to... have a little hope of winning
                one of them.” Baker’s companies owed nearly $30,000 in back taxes, and county tax officials had started
                to sell parcels of his land at auction. </p>
            <p>“Let me give you a hypothetical,” Jacobson said suddenly. “If I were able get a game piece, do you know
                someone who you trust that would cash it?” </p><p>“Are you serious about this?” asked Baker. </p>
            <p>He said he’d need to think about it. But Baker soon realized a windfall would ease his financial woes.
                Soon, Jacobson handed him a $1 million game piece. Whoever redeemed it, he instructed, would have to say
                they pulled it from a hash-brown bag. This time, Jacobson wanted $100,000, the biggest kickback he’d
                ever demanded. “He was a friend,” Jacobson recalled. “I thought I could trust him.”</p>
            <p>“George, you’re not going to believe this,” whispered Baker, leaning over a Waffle House table in Seneca,
                South Carolina. “But I was at breakfast with a friend of mine and he pulled off this winning game
                piece.” George Chandler, 30, was the owner of a successful plastic-injection company, and Baker’s foster
                child. Chandler was a teenager when Baker took him in. “One day he showed up on our doorstep with tears
                in his eyes,” Baker recalled. “His momma had just thrown his clothes out in the middle of the yard
                because he helped his sister go to Georgia get married.”</p>
            <p>Baker showed Chandler the winning game piece in a tiny Ziploc bag, and offered to sell it to him for
                $100,000. Baker explained that the winner was going through a divorce and didn’t want to split his
                McDonald’s winnings with his wife. (Or that was his story.) Chandler could only come up with $50,000,
                but on June 6, 2000, Baker helped him fill out the McDonald’s claim form. They photocopied the game
                piece and mailed it off to the redemption center. Baker warned him four times not to participate in any
                promotions, but on June 26, his telephone rang.</p>
            <p>“You need to be up here at South Union McDonald’s at 11 0’clock,” Chandler said casually. McDonald’s was
                presenting him with a giant check, he said. Baker was incensed. “There’s more to this than you know,” he
                hissed. But it was too late. When Baker arrived at the McDonald’s restaurant, two TV news crews were
                filming Ronald McDonald showering Chandler with confetti. That footage found its way to the FBI Field
                Office in Jacksonville.</p>
            <p>In March of 2001, the McDonald’s promotion started again, with a “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?”
                promotional game. “That’s where the real greed on my part came,” Baker admitted. He asked Jacobson if
                he’d accept a plot of land in Edgewater Hills for a couple of game pieces. Baker gave a $1 million
                winner to a friend, Ronnie Hughey, and a $500,000 winner to his wife’s sister, Brenda Phenis. He gave
                them strict instructions on how to set up fake lives in other states, claim their prizes, and keep their
                mouths shut.</p>
            <p>On April 27, 2001, Dent received a call from McDonald’s, informing him that a Mr. Ronald E. Hughey, a
                lifelong resident of Germantown, Tennessee, had claimed the $1 million prize. When Amy Murray called
                Hughey’s phone, she asked him to appear in a TV commercial, but Hughey said he’d prefer to remain
                anonymous, because he was suffering from depression. Technical agents soon discovered that Hughey’s
                Tennessee telephone number was just a call-forwarding device. He actually lived in Anderson, South
                Carolina, just miles from the home of George Chandler, the latest winner.</p>
            <p>To conceal his sister-in-law’s South Carolina address, Baker took Brenda Phenis on a road trip to North
                Carolina, he recalled. “She had located an apartment, had rented it, obtained a phone, a mailing
                address, bank account, and I think a North Carolina drivers’ license.” On May 16, 2001, Baker stood over
                Phenis’ shoulder as she dialed the McDonald’s hotline and claimed the $500,000 winning ticket. Phenis
                had agreed to pay the taxes, give Baker $90,000 and Jacobson $70,000, and keep $90,000 for herself. “She
                had made commitments to other people that she was going to buy them a car, build a house, and she
                overcommitted,” recalled Baker. Phenis also told her son about the scheme, and his wife, and her other
                sister. </p>
            <p>On May 30, 2001, McDonald’s notified Dent of Phenis’ $500,000 win. He checked the credit bureaus and
                quickly discovered that she too lived in South Carolina, in a town called Westminster. Dent found a map
                of the state, and pinned the addresses of Hughey, Chandler, and Phenis. He had uncovered a 25-mile
                golden triangle of suspicious McDonald’s winners, and at its center was the lakefront home of
                Jacobson.</p>
            <p>Dent requested that McDonald’s delay sending checks to Hughey and Phenis while he applied for wiretaps.
                “This intentional delay... proved very fruitful,” he recalled, because three weeks later everyone was
                panicking. On recorded calls, Jacobson told Baker that Phenis needed to insist on “something in writing”
                from McDonald’s so Baker could make a “legal issue” about the delay. “I’d say… ‘do we need an attorney
                or do I need to call the home office’” Jacobson suggested, “or do I need to call Burger King?”</p>
            <p>“That’s right,” agreed Baker. But deep down, he had a “gut feeling” that they’d been caught. “I felt the
                eyes,” he told me.</p>
            <p>Phenis, too, was feeling the pressure. She confessed to her pastor and stopped answering Baker’s calls.
                He feared she was going to keep the entire check for herself. Dent listened to Baker’s tense phone calls
                with his wife. Baker said that if Jacobson knew that Brenda had gone rogue, he’d report the ticket
                stolen and say he was threatened to hand over the game pieces. Baker decided that Phenis should give him
                the money, otherwise he’d have to “raise his hand” himself, and have the U.S. Marshals arrest her. “I
                want it all,” Baker told his wife. “No if, ands, or buts about it.” He raced to Phenis’ fake apartment
                where the check was due to arrive. When he opened the door he found the light on and the air conditioner
                humming, but no one was in. On the floor, he found a tear-off strip from a FedEx envelope. </p>
            <p>Baker called his wife, and gasped: “Brenda’s running with the money.”</p>
            <p>Time was now ticking for Dent and the FBI. On July 11, they would launch their second and last
                promotional game of 2001. Knowing that the game was compromised, Golden Arches executives considered
                canceling the whole thing. But Dent insisted he needed one more game to gather enough evidence. Jack
                Greenberg, the McDonald’s CEO, had a big decision to make. To run the game knowing it was corrupt could
                invite lawsuits and damage McDonald’s reputation. His company had endured a rough year, with a scare
                over mad cow disease diminishing European sales, and the brand’s domestic business was in a funk. “I had
                to do what was right,” Greenberg later told the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>. “If you’re sitting in my
                chair, I think you’d do the same thing.” </p>
            <p>Backed by a massive promotional campaign, in July McDonald’s launched the “Pick Your Prize Monopoly”
                game. Restaurants nationwide were decorated with Monopoly rooftop banners and drive-thru decals. Diners
                couldn’t escape Rich Uncle Pennybags, who peered out from tray liners and even garbage cans, urging them
                to play. McDonald’s distributed 57 million paper game boards in <em>Time</em>, <em>People,</em> and <em>Sports
                    Illustrated</em>, while radio commercials whipped up interest in the two $1 million prizes, payable
                in “cash, gold, or diamonds.” </p>
            <p>But the two winning game pieces were already in the hands of Jerry Jacobson. </p>
            <p>He gave one to his trusted recruiter Glomb, putting the former drug trafficker on the FBI’s radar for the
                first time, and the other to Baker.</p>
            <p>“I got to have some kind of deposit,” Jacobson told Baker, in a phone call recorded by the FBI. </p>
            <p>“My word’s not good enough, huh?” said Baker. </p>
            <p>“Your word is good,” Jacobson said. “Are you willing to back it up, though?” </p>
            <p>“Yeah, I'll back it up.” </p>
            <p>Baker had other problems. His sister-in-law Phenis had flown to California to receive her $500,000 prize
                directly from Simon Marketing. Baker and his wife had spent days staking out the Indianapolis
                International Airport, watching every incoming flight for her return. On July 20, when Phenis finally
                strolled into arrivals, the Bakers accosted her and found she had $20,ooo in cash and a cashier’s check
                for $480,000. Their tense confrontation was filmed by an undercover team of local FBI agents.</p>
            <p>Driving to a quiet corner of Corbin, Kentucky, Baker handed Jacobson a McDonald’s paper bag containing
                $70,000 in cash, as payment for the next winning ticket. Baker planned to pass the ticket to his last
                winner, Ronnie Hughey, who had recruited “his man in Texas” to win. Listening in to their call, Dent ran
                his finger down a list of numbers recently dialed by Hughey. The only Texas number belonged to Hughey’s
                brother-in-law, a construction manager in Granbury named John Davis.</p>
            <p>On Sunday, July 22, at 10 a.m., two FBI surveillance teams tailed Baker and Jacobson to a secluded area
                in a South Carolina town, named Fair Play, ironically. But the dense, woodland area prevented them from
                witnessing the transfer. Agents then followed Baker to Hughey’s home in Anderson, where they believed he
                passed him the $1 million winning game piece. Eight days later, Dent received a call from Amy Murray.
                Someone had claimed the $1 million, she said. Dent interrupted her. He asked if the winner’s name was
                John Davis.</p><p>Yes, she said.</p><p>“From Granbury, Texas?”</p>
            <p>By giving the go-ahead to run the game, McDonald’s CEO Jack Greenberg had allowed the feds to discover
                Glomb and his network of million-dollar winners. “I would do it again,” Greenberg said. “What we found
                out allowed the FBI to complete its investigation.” Knowing that juries are convinced by splashy stings,
                the FBI asked McDonald’s to help them trap the suspects. Together with Amy Murray, they cooked up a plan
                to invite every corrupt winner to Las Vegas for a “winner reunion,” where the FBI would bust them all at
                once. But they decided against the idea. It was just as effective to shoot fake McDonald’s commercials,
                trapping Glomb’s final winner, Michael Hoover, at his home in Rhode Island. </p>
            <p>Nineteen days later, on Aug. 22, 2001, the FBI fanned out and made eight arrests, including Dwight and
                Linda Baker, John Davis, Andrew Glomb, Michael Hoover, Ronald Hughey, and Brenda Phenis. In a pre-dawn
                raid, FBI agents surrounded Jacobson’s red-brick home, crept up the garden path, and knocked on his
                door. A shocked Jacobson was taken away in handcuffs and charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud,
                his bond set at a staggering $1 million. Staffers at Simon Marketing were left in disbelief. How could
                the man who searched their shoes be guilty of theft?</p>
            <p>The arrests created a media sensation, and Attorney General John Ashcroft told the press: “Those involved
                in this type of corruption will find out that breaking the law is no game.” Americans were shocked that
                McDonald’s customers had been duped for so long. Jeffrey Harris, a former deputy attorney general,
                complained to CNN: “People that were buying the hamburgers, all they were getting at this point was
                cholesterol.” Meanwhile, Jacobson became the butt of the media’s jokes: “Are you worried the police are
                going to take him down the station and give him a grilling?” one newscaster asked. “I’m sorry, I
                couldn’t resist.”</p>
            <p>During his six-hour interrogation, Agent Dent presented Jacobson with their evidence. For over 12 years,
                Jacobson’s scheme had existed only in his mind. Now his crooked plan was a chart on FBI stationery. But
                Jacobson still thought he had his “ace in the hole.” In the weeks that followed, he provided the FBI
                with documents he claimed proved that Simon Marketing rigged McDonald’s contests to bilk Canadian
                customers. A source close to Jacobson told CNN that he also hoped to use his St. Jude’s million-dollar
                donation to try and score a reduced prison sentence. But investigators believed he mailed the game piece
                to the hospital as “a lark,” after failing to recruit a winner in time for the contest deadline.
                (Jacobson declined to be interviewed for this article. Most of his story comes from court
                documents.)</p>
            <p>With each of Jacobson’s nine charges carrying a five-year penalty, investigators warned him he’d be 104
                on his release date. “I wouldn’t be getting out,” he told them, because he had multiple sclerosis. In
                exchange for a signed confession and his testimony in court, Jacobson pleaded guilty to three counts for
                a total of 15 years. The government also took everything he owned. Back in Lawrenceville, his neighbors
                watched as agents drove away in his brand new Honda S2000 sports car and other vehicles, including a
                luxury Acura, a minivan, and an ’86 Chevy El Camino.</p>
            <p>McDonald’s CEO Jack Greenberg told the country in a television address that the company had immediately
                terminated its relationship with Simon Marketing. In Los Angeles, staff silently packed up their desks
                as the company dissolved. “McDonald’s is committed to giving our customers a chance to win every dollar
                that has been stolen by this criminal ring,” Greenberg said later, in a somber TV commercial in which
                McDonald’s unveiled a special $10 million instant giveaway, and asked for a “second chance.” To ensure
                winners were truly chosen at random, there were no game pieces or prize boards. Instead, a prize patrol
                tapped random customers on the shoulder. McDonald’s, which declined to comment for this article, also
                quietly honored the $1 million prize sent to the hospital, which was spent on treatment for kids
                battling cancer and terminal diseases.</p>
            <p>The colorful court case, held in Jacksonville, Florida, started Sept. 10, 2001, the day before terrorists
                crashed planes into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and a field in Pennsylvania. The stunned news
                media quickly forgot about the McDonald’s trial, which explains why so few Americans remember the
                scandal, or how it ended. During the trial, jurors watched defendants celebrating in McDonald’s
                commercials, including the fake winner filmed by the FBI. Glomb recalled that the victim of the McSting,
                Michael Hoover, told him that he thought Amy Murray “kind of liked me,” before learning she was part of
                an FBI operation. </p>
            <div>
                <div><p><span>“</span>For over 12 years, Jacobson’s scheme had existed only in his mind. Now his crooked
                    plan was a chart on FBI stationery.<span>”</span></p></div>
            </div><p>More than 50 defendants were convicted of mail fraud and conspiracy. Jacobson’s
            “super-recruiters”—Schwartz, Hart, Couturier, and Glomb—were sentenced to a year and one day in prison, and
            handed huge fines. Baker recalled that one of the FBI’s top agents, known as the “human lie-detector,”
            interrogated him, and added that if the FBI had focused on surveilling terrorists and not McDonald’s
            winners, 9/11 might never have happened. Baker, who was excommunicated from the Mormon church, his wife
            Linda, her sister Brenda Phenis, and the dozens of other “winners” received only probation and are still
            paying back their prize money at $50 a month. Four winners, including Baker’s foster son Chandler, had their
            convictions overturned by an appeals court, which agreed they were duped by recruiters. </p>
            <p>Richard Couturier, who was sleeping in his car at the time of the trial, told the court that a man he
                believed was in the Mafia warned him not to mention Don Hart’s name to investigators. He said he feared
                getting “whacked.” Then, just before the judge announced her sentence, Robin Colombo caught a glimpse of
                her lawyer’s paperwork, and saw she was going back to prison. She screamed and made a desperate dash for
                the exit, and reached an outer corridor before marshals overpowered her. She was sentenced to 18 months.
                Behind bars, she discovered the Bible and wrote her life story, <em>From a Mafia Widow to Child of
                    God</em>. She was later reunited with her son Frankie, who did not join the mob. </p>
            <p>Jacobson took the stand dressed in a blue golf shirt, looking tired and gray. One attorney described him
                as “a gigantic master criminal,” before he admitted to stealing as many as 60 game pieces over a dozen
                years, totaling over $24 million in prizes. “All I can tell you is I made the biggest mistake of my
                life,” he said quietly, before agreeing to pay $12.5 million in restitution. The judge sent him to jail
                for 37 months. He did not pass go. But before leaving the court he shook hands with the man who brought
                him to justice. Perhaps Jacobson saw in Richard Dent the man he could have been, a steely-minded
                detective. Dent, who declined to be interviewed for this article because he does not speak to the media,
                quietly returned to his work on white-collar crime, and is now retired. </p>
            <p>McDonald’s sued Simon Marketing, which counter-sued. A group of Burger King restaurants tried to get a
                class-action lawsuit together, so did a group of unhappy McDonald’s customers in Canada. The Monopoly
                game had demonstrated the evils of chasing riches at the expense of others, but the saga also proved
                that strange things happen when people conspire to cheat fate. Gennaro Colombo won a car using a stolen
                prize ticket and died in a car wreck. And when lady luck regained control of the McDonald’s
                competitions, she handed winning tickets to a man wearing a full Pizza Hut uniform; a Taco Bell owner;
                and a former homeless man who was later charged with beating up his fiancée—a PR nightmare. </p>
            <p>An audit of newspaper archives from Jacobson’s reign turned up some other interesting “wins.” In 1988 a
                cop in Florida struggling with unpaid bills told reporters how he found a winning McDonald’s game piece
                in his squad car. A year later, a family living just 43 miles from Jacobson’s home won $250,000. Then
                there’s the “impostor” M&amp;M candy, like the one in Robin Colombo’s freezer. In 1997, a newspaper
                reported that a college student in Florida won the $1 million prize, somehow finding the gray-colored M&amp;M
                before Mars even announced the contest. The boy’s father, a Baptist, said that if his son had spent his
                money on a lottery ticket, he would have been sinning. “The Lord doesn’t approve of gambling,” he said.
                “But a candy contest is something different.” The winner and his family did not answer inquiries sent to
                their home in the Carolinas, not far from the golden triangle of Jacobson’s phony winners.</p>
            <p>Not long ago, I spoke to Glomb, one of Jacobson’s “super recruiters.” He was philosophical about his
                conviction. “I’m not one of those people who are mad at [the FBI],” he said. “It was a game, and I
                lost.” Glomb says he still speaks with Jacobson, who is 76 and in poor health, but living a quiet life
                in Georgia. “I hate to say it but I’d probably do it again for the same reason,” Glomb said, rakishly.
                “Every time I talk to Jacobson, I always tease him, I say, ‘You got any tickets?’” </p>
